defmodule Bonny.Pluggable.ApplyDescendants do
  @moduledoc """
  Applies all the descendants added to the `%Bonny.Axn{}` struct.

  ## Options

    * `:events_for_actions` - List of actions for which events will be created
      upon successful apply. Defaults to `[:add, :modify]` (Reconcile actions
      are triggered regularly which would create lots of events for no actions.)

  ##Â Examples

      step Bonny.Pluggable.ApplyDescendants, events_for_actions: [:add, :modify, :reconcile]
