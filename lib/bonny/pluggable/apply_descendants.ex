defmodule Bonny.Pluggable.ApplyDescendants do
  @moduledoc """
  Applies all the descendants added to the `%Bonny.Axn{}` struct.

  ## Options

    * `:events_for_actions` - List of actions for which events will be created
      upon successful apply. Defaults to `[:add, :modify]` (Reconcile actions
      are triggered regularly which would create lots of events for no actions.)
    * `:force` and `:field_manager` - Options forwarded to `K8s.Client.apply()`.

  ##Â Examples

      step Bonny.Pluggable.ApplyDescendants,
        events_for_actions: [:add, :modify, :reconcile],
        field_manager: "MyOperator",
        force: true
